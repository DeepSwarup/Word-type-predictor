# Text Classification with 20 Newsgroups Dataset

This project demonstrates text classification using the 20 Newsgroups dataset, utilizing a pipeline with TF-IDF vectorization and a Naive Bayes classifier.

## Introduction
Text classification is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves categorizing textual data into predefined categories or classes. The 20 Newsgroups dataset is a well-known benchmark for text classification tasks, containing approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents across 20 different topics.

In this project, we explore how to effectively classify documents from the 20 Newsgroups dataset using machine learning techniques. We employ a pipeline that includes TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization and a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier. TF-IDF is used to transform text into numerical features that capture the importance of words in each document relative to the entire corpus. The Naive Bayes classifier, specifically the Multinomial variant, is suitable for handling the resulting sparse TF-IDF matrix and is known for its simplicity and efficiency in text classification tasks.

## Dataset
The 20 Newsgroups dataset spans a wide range of topics such as politics, sports, religion, and technology, among others. Each document in the dataset is labeled with one of these 20 categories, making it ideal for training and evaluating text classification models. The dataset is readily available through `scikit-learn`, a popular machine learning library in Python.

## Dependencies
To run the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed in your Python environment:
- `numpy`: Fundamental package for numerical computing.
- `matplotlib`: Plotting library for visualizations.
- `seaborn`: Statistical data visualization based on matplotlib.
- `scikit-learn`: Machine learning library that provides tools for data mining and data analysis.
